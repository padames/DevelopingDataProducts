## The goal

The goal of this presentation is to show how to transform a data set used to create
a 3-D scatter plot presented in a Master of Science thesis from flow simulation data
into a similar plot but using Plotly from **R**.

This is an assignment for the course **Developing Data Products** taught by Brian Caffo from the 
from the John Hopkins University School of Public Health through Coursera.

## The original plot

Here is the graph to be reproduced in Plotly.

## The data

The original data set for the plot was generated through simulation
using a compiled program written in C++ and the Matlab engine.
The data was stored as a Matlab *.mat* workspace file.

The transformation into a csv was done in a spreadsheet giving 
file *TestDataForPlotly4.csv*.

## Transforming the csv data for plotting in Plotly

```{r transforming, echo = TRUE}

```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
